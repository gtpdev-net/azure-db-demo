# Package List for Debian-based DevContainer
# ================================================================================================
# This file contains all apt packages to be installed in the GitHub Copilot Bootcamp DevContainer.
# 
# Format:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments or section headers (ignored during installation)
#   - Package lines: <package-name>  # Optional inline comment describing the package
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#
# Usage:
#   The Dockerfile processes this file by:
#   1. Filtering out comment-only lines (starting with #)
#   2. Filtering out blank lines
#   3. Extracting the first column (package name) from each line
#   4. Installing all packages with apt-get
#
# To disable a package: Simply add # at the start of the line to comment it out
# To add a package: Add a new line with the package name and comment in the appropriate section
